## Which One Should You Choose?

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Replit Publish** | ✅ Super simple, 1 click, free | URL is slightly longer |
| **Vercel** | ✅ Professional URL, very fast, free | Need GitHub account |
| **Netlify** | ✅ Professional URL, very fast, free | Need GitHub account |

**My recommendation:** **OPTION 1 (Replit Publish)** - It's literally one click and you're done!

## How to Get Your Own Custom Domain (Optional)

Later, if you want your website to have a custom name like `hemlata-jr.com`, you can:

1. Buy a domain from: GoDaddy.com or Namecheap.com ($10-15/year)
2. Connect it to your deployed website (very easy, I can help)
3. Done!
